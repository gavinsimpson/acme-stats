# Data wrangling

Wrangling data is (or should be) the most time-consuming aspect of a study &mdash; once collected!

.row[

.col-7[
*Wrangling* defined as

> engagement in a long, complicated dispute or argument

> round up, herd, or take charge of (livestock)

> alternative to *wangle*, to *manage to obtain (something) by persuading or cleverly manipulating someone*

]

.col-1[

.col-4[
Better alternative to

* data processing
* data munging
* data manipulation
* &hellip;

# Data wrangling and *dplyr*

The *dplyr* package provides **five** key functions to solve most of the data wrangling issues you'll face

1. Choose observations (rows) based on values of variables (cols) &mdash; `filter()`
2. Reorder the observations (rows) &mdash; `arrange()`
3. Choose variables by name or other feature &mdash; `select()`
4. Create new variables as functions of existing ones &mdash; `mutate()`
5. Collapse many values into a single summary &mdash; `summarise()`

Each of these functions can be used with `group_by()` so that they affect each subset of data (group) in turn

These are the key data wrangling *verbs*

---

# Guiding principles

All verbs work in the same way, providing a consistent workflow with known outputs

1. the first argument to the verbs is *always* a data frame

2. subsequent arguments define what you want to with the data frame

3. the result of each verb (what is returned by the function) is *always* a data frame

# Global burden of dinocyst

```{r load-dinocyst}
dino <- read_excel(here("data", "dinocyst-meta.xlsx"), skip = 2,
    na = c("", "---", "-----"))
```

```{r dinocyst-show-data, echo = TRUE}
dino
```

---

# Clean up column names

```{r janitor}
library("janitor")
dino <- dino %>% janitor::clean_names()
names(dino)
```

---

# `filter()`

Subset observations based on the values or one or more of the columns

```{r dinocyst-filter-2017}
filter(dino, coring_device == "Box corer")
```

---

# The pipe `%>%`

The nature of *dplyr* verbs leads to a workflow where we create intermediate steps

1. group the data using `group_by()`
2. summarise the grouped data by group using `summarise()`

We perhaps don't need to store the output of the first operation

The pipe operator `%>%` allows use to compose *dplyr* verbs into a workflow to achieve a data wrangling outcome

---

# Plot

```{r gbd-2017-plot-prep}
dino_box <- dino %>%
    filter(coring_device == "Box corer")
dino_box
```

---

```{r gbd-2017-plot, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(dino_box, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, fill = dinocyst_count)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme(legend.position = "top") +
    labs(x = "longitude", y = "latitude", fill = NULL) +
    coord_map(projection = "orthographic",
        orientation = c(40, -20, 0))
```

---

# `arrange()`

Sort the rows according to a condition or variable

```{r dinocyst-arrange-deaths}
arrange(dino, dinocyst_count)
```

---

# `desc()`

Arrange in descending order using `desc()`

```{r dinocyst-arrange-rating-desc}
arrange(dino, desc(dinocyst_count))
```

---

# `select()`

Choose which variables to view or work with

```{r dinocyst-select, error = TRUE}
select(dino, c(latitude, longitude, dinocyst_count))
```

---

# `select()` &mdash; many options for selecting

.row[

.col-6[

`matches()`

```{r dinocyst-select-matches}
select(dino, matches("dinocyst"))
```
]

.col-6[

`last_col()`

```{r dinocyst-select-last-col}
select(dino, last_col())
```
]
]

---

# `select()` &mdash; many options for selecting

.row[

.col-6[

`from:to`

```{r dinocyst-select-colon}
select(dino, latitude:coring_device)
```
]

.col-6[

`starts_with()`

```{r dinocyst-select-starts-with}
select(dino, starts_with("l"))
```
]
]

---

# `select()` &mdash; many options for selecting

Many options for choosing columns in `select` &mdash; see `?dplyr::select`

---

# `summarise()`

Summarise data to a single row

```{r dinocyst-summarise}
dino %>% summarise(total_cysts = sum(dinocyst_count, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# `group_by()`

`summarise()` becomes much more useful if we group data first

```{r dinocyst-group-by}
dino %>%
    group_by(coring_device) %>%
    summarise(total_cysts = sum(dinocyst_count, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Can group by multiple variables; grouping applied in the order given

---

# `mutate()`

Create new variable or modify existing ones

```{r dinocyst-mutate}
dino %>%
    group_by(coring_device) %>%
    summarise(count_per_device = sum(dinocyst_count, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    mutate(total_count = sum(count_per_device)) %>% #<<
    ungroup()
```

# Tidying data with *tidyr*

---

# Tidy data

> Tidy datasets provide a standardized way to link the structure of a dataset (its physical layout) with its semantics (its meaning). &ndash; **Hadley Wickham**

A way to arrange data that facilitates subsequent exploration, transformation, visualization, & modelling of the data where

* each column is a variable
* each row is observation

---

# Wide or long?

Often store species data in wide format

```{r show-dino-wide, echo = FALSE}
library("tidyr")
col_types <- rep(c('text', 'numeric'), times = c(1, 71))
dino_wide <- read_excel(here("data", "dinocyst.xlsx"), range = "A3:BT1971",
    col_types = col_types) %>%
    rename(site = `Site number`)
dino_wide
```

---

Look at an alternative way of storing the rectangular data

```{r show-gbd-wide, echo = FALSE}
dino_long <- dino_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = Aand:Dcha, names_to = "taxon", values_to = "count")
dino_long
```

---

# Wide or long?

The data are also in what we call wide format &mdash; where multiple observations are in a row

To fit a statistical model we need them in long format &mdash; where each row corresponds to a single observation

---

# Wide or long?

```{r show-wide-long-image, echo = FALSE, out.width = '80%', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('resources/original-dfs-tidy.png')
```

---

# Pivoting

Converting between a *wide* and *long* representations is called *pivoting*

```{r show-wide-long-git, echo = FALSE, out.width = '50%', fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('resources/tidyr-longer-wider.gif')
```

---

# `pivot_longer()`

To go from the wide version of `dino_wide` to the long form we use `pivot_longer()`

```{r pivot-dinocyst-longer}
dino_wide %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = Aand:Dcha, # which columns to pivot
        names_to = "taxon",        # variables to create in long form
        values_to = "count")       # column to put the data into
```

---

# `pivot_wider()`

Wider forms of data tend to be easier for humans to work with outside R


```{r pivot-dinocyst-wider}
dino_long %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = taxon,      # which columns to spread out
                values_from = count) %>% # which column to take data from
    head()                               # show just first 6 rows
```
